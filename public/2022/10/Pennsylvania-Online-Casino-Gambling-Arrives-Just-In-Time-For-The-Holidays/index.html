<h1 id="Parx-Casino-Launches-First-Legal-Real-Money-Online-Casino-In-Pennsylvania"><a href="#Parx-Casino-Launches-First-Legal-Real-Money-Online-Casino-In-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="Parx Casino Launches First Legal Real Money Online Casino In Pennsylvania"></a>Parx Casino Launches First Legal Real Money Online Casino In Pennsylvania</h1><p>The Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania has become the first casino in the state to launch a legal real money online casino. The website, which offers slot and table games, went live on October 3.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer our players the opportunity to experience our great games and entertainment offerings from the comfort of their own homes,” said Casey Runyan, vice president of online gaming for Parx Casino. “This is another great way for us to bring Parx Casino’s world-class gaming experience to even more people.”</p>
<p>Players must be physically located in Pennsylvania in order to play on the site. The casino is also offering a free $10 no-deposit bonus to new players.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been available in Pennsylvania since 2010, when the state became the third in the nation to legalize it. However, there have been no legal real money online casinos operating in the state until now. In July, lawmakers approved regulations that would allow casinos to offer online gaming, including poker and casino games such as slots and blackjack.</p>
<p>One reason for the delay in launching online casinos was that casinos were waiting for approval from regulators about how much tax they would have to pay on online gambling profits. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board announced last month that taxes on online gambling would be set at 14 percent, which is lower than the tax rate for live table games (27 percent) and slot machines (52 percent).</p>
<p>According to industry analysts, Pennsylvanians wagered more than $225 million on illegal offshore websites in 2017. With a regulated and taxed market now available, that number is expected to decline significantly.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Residents-Can-Now-Gamble-At-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Residents-Can-Now-Gamble-At-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Residents Can Now Gamble At Online Casinos"></a>Pennsylvania Residents Can Now Gamble At Online Casinos</h1><p>Pennsylvania residents can now legally gamble at online casinos. On October 17, 2017, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) unanimously voted to approve interactive gaming, which includes online poker, casino games, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The PGCB said that it will issue up to 12 licenses for online casinos and another 36 licenses for online poker sites. The board also said that it will award licenses to operators who wish to offer both casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have all legalized some form of internet gambling.</p>
<p>Online gambling is a big business. In 2016, global revenue from online gambling was estimated at $41.5 billion. This is expected to grow to $55.8 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Legislators in Pennsylvania believe that legalizing online gambling will bring in much-needed revenue to the state. In fiscal year 2018-2019, the state is expecting to bring in $200 million from licensing fees and taxes on online gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for people who are unable to control their spending habits. They also point out that there is no way to ensure that people who are under 18 years old are not playing casino games or betting on sports matches.</p>
<h1 id="Parx-Casino-Goes-Live-With-Online-Gaming-In-Pennsylvania"><a href="#Parx-Casino-Goes-Live-With-Online-Gaming-In-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="Parx Casino Goes Live With Online Gaming In Pennsylvania"></a>Parx Casino Goes Live With Online Gaming In Pennsylvania</h1><p>The Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, went live with online gaming this week. The casino is partnering with GAN, a leading supplier of internet gaming content and technology, to offer online casino games to players in the state.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be working with GAN as our partner in launching our online gaming operation,” said Tim Wilmott, CEO of Parx Casino. “With their experience and expertise in the field, we know that we are well positioned for a successful launch.”</p>
<p>Players in Pennsylvania will have access to a wide range of online casino games, including slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette. They will also be able to take part in tournaments and enjoy social features like chat and leaderboards.</p>
<p>“GAN is honored to be working with Parx Casino as they go live with their online gaming operation in Pennsylvania,” said Dermot Smurfit, CEO of GAN. “We look forward to helping them deliver an engaging and entertaining experience that will be enjoyed by players throughout the state.”</p>
<p>The launch of Parx Casino’s online gaming operation comes at a time when interest in online gambling is growing rapidly in the United States. Currently, there are six states where online gambling is legal: New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, West Virginia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. And more states are likely to legalize it in the near future as they look for ways to generate new revenue streams.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Milestone-For-Pennsylvania-Parx-Casino-Launches-First-Real-Money-Online-Casino"><a href="#Another-Milestone-For-Pennsylvania-Parx-Casino-Launches-First-Real-Money-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Another Milestone For Pennsylvania: Parx Casino Launches First Real Money Online Casino"></a>Another Milestone For Pennsylvania: Parx Casino Launches First Real Money Online Casino</h1><p>Pennsylvania gambling regulators have given the green light to Parx Casino’s new real money online casino, making it the first casino in the state to offer such games.</p>
<p>“The launch of our new online casino is a significant milestone for Parx Casino as we continue to grow and diversify our business,” said George Hulme, president and CEO of Bensalem-based Parx Casino.</p>
<p>Online casino games are becoming increasingly popular, with industry experts predicting that they will soon overtake traditional gambling methods such as slot machines and table games. In Pennsylvania, there are already 12 licensed casinos, and online gambling is expected to bring in an additional $100 million in revenue each year.</p>
<p>Parx Casino’s new online casino offers a variety of games, including blackjack, slots, roulette and poker. It also offers a range of bonuses and promotions, including a 100% first deposit bonus up to $500. Players can also earn rewards points that can be redeemed for free play or merchandise from the casino’s online store.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of its online casino, Parx Casino is giving away free $10 no-deposit bonuses to all players who sign up before December 31st. Simply use the promo code “FREE10” when signing up.</p>
