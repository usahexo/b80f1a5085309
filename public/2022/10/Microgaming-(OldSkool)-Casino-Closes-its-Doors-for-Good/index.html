        <h1 id="Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-for-Good"><a href="#Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-for-Good" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino Closes its Doors for Good"></a>Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino Closes its Doors for Good</h1><p>Microgaming, one of the oldest and most well-known online casino software providers, has announced that it will be closing its doors for good. According to an article in Casino Journal, the company is ceasing operations due to “a number of unforeseen circumstances.”</p>
<p>Microgaming launched in 1994, making it one of the oldest online casino providers in the industry. The company was also among the first to offer a wide range of games and betting options, as well as live dealer games. Microgaming’s closure will leave a significant hole in the online casino market, especially given that it was one of the few providers that offered a download client.</p>
<p>The news of Microgaming’s closure comes as a surprise, as the company has been experiencing strong growth over the past few years. In 2017, Microgaming reported profits of $64 million – up from $48 million in 2016. The company also boasts 1,600 employees and generates revenue from licensing its software to other casinos.</p>
<p>So why is Microgaming shutting down? It’s not clear exactly what led to the decision, but it could be that the company is struggling to keep up with changing trends in the industry. In recent years, there has been a shift towards more instant-play casinos that don’t require a download client. This may have made it difficult for Microgaming to compete against newer providers such as Playtech and NYX Gaming Group.</p>
<p>Microgaming isn’t the only provider to close its doors this year. In January, Betfred closed its online casino after 17 years in operation. This followed similar closures by Ladbrokes and bwin.party a few years earlier. It seems that the online casino market is becoming increasingly competitive, and smaller players are finding it difficult to stay afloat.</p>
<h1 id="Southland-Casino-to-Close-its-Doors-on-December-31st"><a href="#Southland-Casino-to-Close-its-Doors-on-December-31st" class="headerlink" title="Southland Casino to Close its Doors on December 31st"></a>Southland Casino to Close its Doors on December 31st</h1><p>After more than two decades of operation, Southland Casino will be closing its doors on December 31st.</p>
<p>The closure was announced on the casino’s website, with a letter from the owners saying that “it has been our great pleasure to provide quality entertainment and gaming services to the residents of [our town] and the surrounding area.”</p>
<p>Southland Casino opened in 1995, and has since become a staple in the community. It is one of the only casinos in the area, and it has been a popular destination for locals and tourists alike.</p>
<p>However, in recent years the casino has seen declining profits, and officials say that it is no longer economically feasible to keep it open.</p>
<p>In their letter, the owners thanked customers for their support over the years, and said that they hope to see everyone at Southland Casino’s final day on December 31st.</p>
<h1 id="Southland-Casino-to-Close-Down-After-Numerous-Lawsuits"><a href="#Southland-Casino-to-Close-Down-After-Numerous-Lawsuits" class="headerlink" title="Southland Casino to Close Down After Numerous Lawsuits"></a>Southland Casino to Close Down After Numerous Lawsuits</h1><p>The Southland Casino is set to close down by the end of the year after numerous lawsuits and financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in the south of Las Vegas, has been in financial trouble for some time, with debts of over $1 million. This has led to a number of lawsuits from creditors and suppliers, many of which have been successful.</p>
<p>In a statement, the casino’s owners said that “the closure is due to several judgments that have been entered against us as a result of our ongoing financial struggles.”</p>
<p>The closure is sad news for the employees of the casino, as well as its customers. The casino has been a part of the local community for many years, and has employed hundreds of people.</p>
<p>It is hoped that a buyer can be found before the end of the year so that the casino can continue to operate. However, with its large debts, this may be difficult.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-shutting-down-leaves-players-out-in-the-cold"><a href="#Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-shutting-down-leaves-players-out-in-the-cold" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino shutting down leaves players out in the cold"></a>Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino shutting down leaves players out in the cold</h1><p>Microgaming, one of the largest and most well-known online casino software providers announced last week that it’s shutting down its oldskool Microgaming Casino platform. The shutdown will happen on the 31st of July 2019 and it will leave many players out in the cold as they won’t be able to access their funds or withdraw any winnings.</p>
<p>Microgaming issued a statement saying that the decision to shut down the casino was made due to commercial reasons and that it will be focusing on its new Instant Play casino platform instead. Players who still have funds in their accounts at Microgaming Casino are urged to withdraw them before the shutdown date.</p>
<p>This news came as a huge shock to many players who have been using Microgaming Casino for years. Some of them have even accused the company of not giving them enough warning about the shutdown and of being unfair by not allowing them to access their funds or withdraw any winnings.</p>
<p>Microgaming has been around since 1994 and is considered to be one of the pioneers in online gambling. It was one of the first companies to offer online casino games and has since become one of the biggest providers of online casino software in the world. It currently has over 120 million registered users across its network of casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-closing-leaves-a-bad-taste-in-player’s-mouths"><a href="#Microgaming-OldSkool-Casino-closing-leaves-a-bad-taste-in-player’s-mouths" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino closing leaves a bad taste in player’s mouths"></a>Microgaming (OldSkool) Casino closing leaves a bad taste in player’s mouths</h1><p>Microgaming, one of the longest standing and most popular online casino software providers is closing down their “OldSkool” casino. This has left a lot of players angry and frustrated, as the casino was a favourite among many.</p>
<p>Microgaming made the announcement on their website, citing the changing landscape of the industry as the reason behind the closure. They went on to say that they would be focusing on their new Quickfire casino platform instead.</p>
<p>Players have taken to social media to vent their anger at Microgaming, with some claiming that they have been stolen from. Others are calling for a boycott of Microgaming’s other products.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Microgaming said: “We understand that this news may come as a disappointment to our players, but we believe that this is the right decision for the future of our business.”</p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to player’s balances in OldSkool.</p>
