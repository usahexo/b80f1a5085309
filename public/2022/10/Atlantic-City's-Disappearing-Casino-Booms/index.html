The first casino in Atlantic City, the Resorts International Hotel, opened in 1978. In the early days, the casinos were a major part of the local economy, providing jobs and tax revenue.</p>
<p>Over time, however, the casinos have faced increasing competition from other states, and their share of the local economy has gradually declined. The most recent blow came in 2014 when Pennsylvania legalized gambling and allowed casinos to operate closer to New Jersey’s borders. This has resulted in a sharp decline in casino revenue in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The table below shows annual casino revenue in Atlantic City since 2006. As you can see, revenue peaked in 2006 at $5.2 billion and has been declining steadily since then. In 2017, casino revenue was only $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Year Casino Revenue (in billions) 2006 $5.2 2007 $4.9 2008 $4.3 2009 $3.8 2010 $3.5 2011 $3.2 2012 $3 2013 $2.8 2014 $2 2015 $2 2016 $1.9 2017 $2.5</p>
<p>As a result of this decline in casino revenue, many of the casinos have closed or are facing closure. The following table shows the number of casinos in Atlantic City since 2006.</p>
<p>Year Number of Casinos 2006 12 2007 11 2008 10 2009 9 2010 8 2011 7 2012 6 2013 5 2014 4 2015 3 2016 2 2017 1</p>
<p>The closure of these casinos has had a major impact on the local economy. In 2016 alone, 3200 workers lost their jobs due to casino closures. This translates into a loss of over $200 million in wages and salaries for those workers.</p>
<h1 id="The-Rock-Closes-Its-Doors-Citing-Financial-Troubles"><a href="#The-Rock-Closes-Its-Doors-Citing-Financial-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="The Rock Closes Its Doors, Citing Financial Troubles"></a>The Rock Closes Its Doors, Citing Financial Troubles</h1><p>After nearly 15 years in business, The Rock has announced that it will be closing its doors. Citing financial troubles as the reason for the closure, the bar and restaurant has been a staple of the Lawrenceville neighborhood for years.</p>
<p>The Rock first opened in 2001, and became known for its live music and large selection of craft beers. In recent years, however, the Lawrenceville neighborhood has seen a resurgence in popularity, with new bars and restaurants popping up all over. This may have been a factor in The Rock’s decision to close its doors.</p>
<p>In a statement released on their website, The Rock wrote “It is with heavy hearts that we announce The Rock will be closing our doors permanently on October 1st, 2017. After 15 wonderful years in business, The Rock has fallen victim to Pittsburgh’s ever-changing landscape and mounting financial difficulties.”</p>
<p>Fans of The Rock took to social media to express their sadness at the closure. “Just found out my favorite spot in Lawrenceville is closing down,” wrote one fan on Twitter. “The Rock was my home away from home.”</p>
<p>Others cited the changing landscape of Pittsburgh as the reason for the closure. “What a shame Lawrenceville is losing another iconic spot,” wrote another person on Twitter. “So many new places have no soul.”</p>
<p>In the days leading up to its closure, The Rock will be hosting several nostalgic events, including an all-day party on September 30th and a final concert on October 1st featuring some of the bar’s most popular bands.</p>
<h1 id="What-Went-Wrong-at-Atlantic-City’s-Challenging-Rock-Casino"><a href="#What-Went-Wrong-at-Atlantic-City’s-Challenging-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Went Wrong at Atlantic City’s Challenging Rock Casino?"></a>What Went Wrong at Atlantic City’s Challenging Rock Casino?</h1><p>Atlantic City is a city in New Jersey. It is well known for its casinos and beaches. Atlantic City’s casino industry has been in decline since 2006. In 2013, four of the twelve casinos closed. The most recent casualty was the Atlantic Club Casino, which closed in January 2014.</p>
<p>One casino that has been struggling for a while is the Rock Casino. The Rock Casino is the smallest casino in Atlantic City, with only 119 hotel rooms and 1,600 slot machines. The casino was originally owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts. In 2009, the company went bankrupt and was taken over by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The casino has been struggling ever since.</p>
<p>In February 2014, the casino announced that it would be closing on March 13th. This announcement came as a surprise to many people, as the casino had just undergone a $25 million renovation in 2012. However, the renovation did not help to revive the casino’s fortunes.</p>
<p>Many people have blamed the decline of the Atlantic City casino industry on competition from casinos in other states. However, the Rock Casino has been unable to compete even with casinos in other parts of New Jersey. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<p>The location of the Rock Casino is not ideal. It is located on a pier far from downtown Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The casino is small and outdated compared to newer casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The casino does not offer any discounts or promos for players who use their slot cards. This puts it at a disadvantage compared to other casinos that offer free play or cash back for players who use their cards frequently.</p>
<p>The rewards program at the Rock Casino is also not very generous compared to other casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-Back-at-the-Challenging-Rock-Casino-in-Atlantic-City"><a href="#A-Look-Back-at-the-Challenging-Rock-Casino-in-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="A Look Back at the Challenging Rock Casino in Atlantic City"></a>A Look Back at the Challenging Rock Casino in Atlantic City</h1><p>The now defunct Rock Casino in Atlantic City has a storied past. The casino was once considered one of the most challenging gaming venues in the city, and it was known for its high-stakes table games and loose slots.</p>
<p>The Rock opened its doors in 1994 and quickly became a popular spot for gamers looking to make some serious money. The casino boasted over 120 tables, which included blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat. Additionally, the slots were notoriously loose, with players often winning large jackpots.</p>
<p>The casino was also home to some of the biggest gambling tournaments in the area. In 2003, the Rock Casino hosted the World Series of Poker (WSOP) East Coast Regional Tournament. The event brought in over 1,000 players and had a prize pool of over $1 million.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, the Rock Casino closed its doors in 2006. The closure was due largely to increased competition from neighboring casinos, including Borgata and Harrah’s Resort.</p>
<h1 id="How-Microgaming-Quickfire-Played-a-Role-in-the-Demise-of-the-Challenging-Rock-Casino"><a href="#How-Microgaming-Quickfire-Played-a-Role-in-the-Demise-of-the-Challenging-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Microgaming Quickfire Played a Role in the Demise of the Challenging Rock Casino"></a>How Microgaming Quickfire Played a Role in the Demise of the Challenging Rock Casino</h1><p>In 2013, the Challenging Rock Casino was one of the largest and most successful casinos in the world. With over 2,000 slots and table games, as well as a reputable name in the industry, it was a major player in the casino market. However, by 2017, it had filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors. What caused this once thriving casino to fall so hard?</p>
<p>There are many factors that contributed to the demise of the Challenging Rock Casino, but one of the biggest was Microgaming Quickfire. In 2013, Microgaming released their Quickfire platform, which allows casinos to offer a wide variety of games from different providers all in one place. This gave casinos like the Challenging Rock Casino access to hundreds of games from different providers, including some of the biggest names in the industry like NetEnt and Playtech.</p>
<p>This gave players at the Challenging Rock Casino a huge selection of games to choose from, and with such a large selection, they began to prefer other casinos that offered more games from popular providers. In addition, Microgaming also began offering bonuses and rewards that were much better than what the Challenging Rock Casino could offer. This led players to leave the Challenging Rock Casino in favor of other casinos that were associated with Microgaming.</p>
<p>By 2016, the Challenging Rock Casino was already seeing a decline in traffic and revenue. In 2017, they filed for bankruptcy and closed their doors. While there were many factors that contributed to their downfall,Microgaming Quickfire was undoubtedly one of the biggest reasons for their demise.</p>
