#  What Does Straight Mean in Sports? The Answer May Surprise You

For athletes, Straight is an adjective used to describe a player who is not "gay." The term is often used in contrast to "gay," which is typically used to describe players who display characteristics that are seen as feminine or weak.

While Straight has been used for many years in sports, its definition has shifted over time. Originally, Straight referred to players who were not interested in other men sexually. However, in recent years the term has been used to describe players who are not "weak" or "effeminate." As such, the definition of Straight is now more complex than simply being not interested in men sexually.

The use of the term Straight varies depending on the sport. For example, it is more commonly used in team sports like football and basketball than it is in individual sports like tennis and golf. This may be because team sports are seen as being more masculine than individual sports.

Despite its variations, the definition of Straight remains relatively constant across different sports. Generally speaking, Straight refers to a player who is strong and aggressive, while gay refers to a player who is weak and unaggressive.

#  Straight: The Most Misunderstood Word in Sports

There are so many incorrect connotations and implications with the word "straight" in sports. The two most popular uses of the word is when a player says they're "straight cash, no perks" or when referring to someone as a "straight shooter". 

In the first instance, players often use the term to mean that they don't want any special treatment - they just want to be paid what they're worth. Kobe Bryant was infamous for using this phrase, famously saying "I'm not Shaq, I'm not asking for $30 million. I'm asking for $10 million. I'm straight cash, no perks." This usage of the word actually has its roots in black culture, where "being straight" is used as a euphemism for being successful or wealthy. 

In the second instance, players sometimes use "straight shooter" to describe someone who is honest and doesn't beat around the bush. For example, Steph Curry once said "He's a straight shooter. He doesn't BS you. He tells you how it is." This usage of the word comes from poker, where a "straight shooter" is a player who doesn't cheat. 

Both of these usages of the word are completely different from its original meaning, which is simply someone who isn't gay. The word has been appropriated by the sports world to mean something else entirely, and most people don't even know its true origins. This is just one example of how words can take on new meanings in sports, and it's something that we should all be aware of.

#  Why is 21 Blackjack Considered a Straight Sport?

For many individuals, 21 blackjack is considered a straight sport because of the mathematical odds that are involved. In order to win, the player must have a hand total that is closer to 21 than the dealer. The house edge is also what makes this game so popular, as it is typically lower than other casino games.

Players can improve their chances of winning by using basic strategy, which involves making the best decision for each hand depending on the cards that are dealt. This includes things such as hitting or standing based on the player's total and the dealer's upcard. 

With a little bit of practice, players can learn how to use basic strategy and give themselves the best chance to walk away a winner at the blackjack table.

#  Defining Straight in the World of Sports

In the world of sports, there are many straight athletes who have come out and played at the top of their game. These individuals have made a significant impact in changing the perception of what it means to be straight and have helped to break down barriers for those who identify as LGBTQ+.

One such athlete is Michael Sam. He was the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL and he played for the St. Louis Rams before being cut from the team. Despite this setback, Sam continued to be an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has spoken out about his experience as a gay man in professional sports.

Other high-profile straight athletes who have come out include Robbie Rogers of the Los Angeles Galaxy and Jason Collins of the Brooklyn Nets. Collins was the first openly gay man in any major American sport and he received a great deal of support from his teammates and peers. Rogers also spoke out about his experience as a gay professional athlete, and he has been outspoken about the need for more inclusion in sport at all levels.

These athletes have shown that it is possible to be both successful and openly queer in professional sports. They have also helped to create a more inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ athletes, which is crucial given that only 2-5% of all athletes are Out.[1] In order for all individuals to feel comfortable participating in sport, we need more openly queer athletes who can serve as role models for younger players.

There are also many straight allies in sport who have worked tirelessly to promote equality and inclusion. One notable example is Billie Jean King, who was a pioneer for women’s tennis back in the 1970s. King fought hard for equal prize money and she was also one of the first prominent athletes to come out as lesbian. Her advocacy has made a lasting impact on both women’s sport and LGBTQ+ rights overall.

The work done by these straight allies is invaluable, and they continue to play an important role in creating a more inclusive society. By working together, we can help make sport more open and inclusive for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

#  How to Play 21 Blackjack in a Straight Manner

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games that can be found in just about any establishment. It is a very simple game to play and doesn’t take long to learn the basics. The following guide will teach you how to play blackjack in a way that will give you the best chance at winning.

The first thing that you need to do is place your bet. Blackjack tables usually have betting minimums and maximums, so it is important that you familiarize yourself with these before playing. Once your bet has been placed, the dealer will deal out two cards to each player and two cards face up to themselves. The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points, while all other cards are worth face value.

Your objective in blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points. If your hand contains more than 21 points, then you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s hand is. If your hand equals 21 points (a “blackjack”), then you automatically win regardless of what the dealer has. You can also win if the dealer busts by having more than 21 points on their hand.

To start, you will want to take a look at your first two cards and see if you have a natural blackjack (Ace and 10). If you do, then announce “blackjack” and stand (stop taking card). If you don’t have a natural blackjack, then continue playing by taking one card at a time until you either reach 21 or go over (bust). At this point, if the dealer has not busted, then compare your hand with theirs in order to see who has won.
