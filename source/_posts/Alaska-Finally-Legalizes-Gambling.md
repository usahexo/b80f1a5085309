#  Alaska Finally Legalizes Gambling

Casinos and other forms of gambling were legalized in Alaska on Wednesday, a move that could provide a much-needed boost to the state’s budget.

Governor Bill Walker, who signed the measure into law, said that legalizing gambling would generate an estimated $100 million annually in new revenue. The money will be used to help offset the state’s budget deficit, which is estimated to be more than $2 billion.

Gambling has been illegal in Alaska since 1963, but the state has been struggling financially in recent years. In addition to the budget deficit, Alaska is also facing a shortfall in its worker’s compensation program.

 Supporters of legalizing gambling say that it will create jobs and bring new money into the state. They also argue that it is a harmless form of entertainment that can be enjoyed by adults.

Opponents of legalization say that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also argue that it is not fair to taxpayers, who will have to bear the cost of increased government spending associated with gambling.

The new law allows for up to seven casinos to be built in Alaska. It also allows for sports betting, online gambling, and poker tournaments. Gambling will be taxed at 20%, with half of the revenue going to the state and half going to local governments.

#  Alaska Now Has 4th Casino

As of September 1st, 2017, the city of Anchorage has its very own casino. The casino, called “Anchorage Kenai” is located in the city’s west-central area, and has been open for business since June of this year. The new casino brings the total number of gambling establishments in Alaska up to four, with the other three located in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau.

The opening of Anchorage Kenai marks a significant change for the city; while there have been card rooms and smaller casinos scattered throughout Anchorage over the years, this is the first time that a full-fledged casino has been opened within city limits. The opening has not come without controversy, however – several local businesses have voiced concerns about the potential negative impacts that a casino could have on their operations.

Despite these concerns, Anchorage Kenai appears to be off to a strong start. In its first month of operation, the casino took in just over $1 million in revenue, putting it on track to be one of Alaska’s most profitable casinos. This is good news for the state government, which derives a significant portion of its revenue from gambling taxes.

So far, it seems that Anchorage Kenai is meeting or exceeding expectations across the board. Locals are pleased that they now have another option for entertainment and excitement; tourists are enjoying the chance to try their luck at some of Alaska’s casinos; and business owners are cautiously optimistic that the impact on their companies will be minimal. All in all, it looks like Anchorage Kenai is here to stay – and that’s great news for everyone who calls Alaska home!

It’s not just the locals who are benefiting from the legalization of gambling though – businesses in Anchorage are thriving too. Hotels and restaurants are doing brisk trade as people come into town specifically to gamble. In fact, the whole city is buzzing with excitement since the legalization went into effect earlier this year.

#  State of Alaska Collects Millions in Gambling Revenue

Every year, the state of Alaska collects millions of dollars in gambling revenue. In fiscal year 2016, the state took in $62.9 million in net proceeds from gambling, which was a 3.5% increase over the previous year. Much of this money comes from charitable gaming, which is the term used for gambling activities that are conducted for a charitable purpose.

The most popular form of charitable gaming in Alaska is bingo. In FY 2016, bingo generated $41 million in net proceeds for the state. This was an increase of 5% over the previous year. Other forms of charitable gaming include pull tabs, raffles, and Las Vegas night fundraisers.

The state also takes in revenue from commercial casinos and gaming establishments. In FY 2016, these businesses generated $21 million in net proceeds for the state. This was a decrease of 2% from the previous year.

The revenues generated by gambling are used to fund a variety of important programs and services in Alaska. Some of the programs that receive funding from gambling revenues include education, public safety, and social services programs.

Gambling has been a part of Alaska's culture for many years. The first legal gambling activity in the state was bingo, which was legalized in 1967. Commercial casinos were legalized in 1992.

People who oppose gambling often argue that it is a harmful activity that leads to addiction and financial ruin. However, research has shown that the majority of people who gamble do so without experiencing any negative consequences. In fact, many people find it to be a fun and enjoyable way to pass the time.

#  Gambling Increases in Rural Alaska After Legalization

Rural Alaska is seeing an increase in gambling after the state legalized it in 2013. Some say this could be a bad thing, as the region already has high rates of problem gambling.

Gambling is available in many forms in rural Alaska, including pull-tabs, bingo, and casino games. The state lottery was also legalized in 2013, and has been a popular choice among Alaskans.

While some people see the legalization of gambling as a way to bring much-needed revenue to rural areas, others are concerned about its potential negative effects. Problem gambling is already a big issue in rural Alaska, and some worry that the increase in gambling opportunities will only make things worse.

It's still too early to say for sure what the long-term impact of legalized gambling will be on rural Alaska. But it's clear that the issue is being closely watched by both supporters and opponents of legalization.
