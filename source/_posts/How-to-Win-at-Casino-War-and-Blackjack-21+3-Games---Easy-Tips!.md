# How to Win at Casino War and Blackjack 21+3 Games - Easy Tips!

Casino War and Blackjack 21+3 games are two of the most popular casino table games. They are both very simple to play and offer relatively good odds for the player. If you want to improve your chances of winning at these games, follow these easy tips!

# How to Win at Casino War

In Casino War, the goal is to beat the dealer's hand. The basic rules are very simple - just match the rank of your card with the rank of the dealer's card, and if you have a higher rank, you win!

There are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning at Casino War:

- Stick to lower denomination cards. This will give you more chances to win, since there are more low ranking cards than high ranking cards.

- Split pairs whenever possible. This gives you twice as many chances of winning.

- Avoid ties. Ties result in a 'push' and you neither win nor lose money. It's better to risk losing a little bit in order to try and win big.

- Use basic strategy charts to help guide your decisions. These charts are available online or in most casino gaming guides.




If you follow these tips, you'll be on your way to winning at Casino War!

# How to Win at Blackjack 21+3 Games

Blackjack 21+3 is a game that combines blackjack and poker into one exciting game. The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer, or by having a higher poker hand than the dealer. Again, the rules are very simple and can be learned in just a few minutes.

There are also a few things that you can do to increase your chances of winning at blackjack:

- Stay away from high denomination cards. Just like in Casino War, stick to lower denomination cards which give you more chances of winning. This will also help keep your betting amount within your budget.

- Always split Aces and 8s. Splitting Aces gives you two hands that have an Ace as their highest card, which is great for drawing additional cards without going over 21. Splitting 8s gives you two hands with potential scores of 17 or 18 - much better than standing with one hand containing an 8!
5s and 2s should generally not be split, except against a dealers 9, 10, or ace (in which case 5s become valuable). All other splits should be considered on a case by case basis when using basic strategy charts found online or in gaming guides).



 By following these tips, you'll have a much better chance of winning at blackjack!

# Casino War: How to ALWAYS Win! 

Casino War is one of the easiest casino games to learn and play, making it a great option for novice players. The premise is simple: bet on the outcome of a face-off between a player and the dealer. If the player's card is higher than the dealer's, they win; if the dealer's card is higher, the player loses.

But what if you could ALWAYS win at Casino War? Here's how:

1. Before playing, ask the dealer to give you an extra card. If your card is higher than the dealer's, you win; if it's lower, you lose.

2. If you're dealt two cards of equal value, ask for a third card. If this card is higher than either of your first two cards, you win; if it's lower, your original bet is lost.

3. With a little bit of practice, you'll be able to consistently beat the dealer and walk away with your profits!

# How to Easily Win at Casino War and Blackjack 21+3 Games 

Whether you're a casino novice or seasoned pro, there are certain strategies you can use to up your chances of winning at games like Casino War and Blackjack 21+3. In this article, we'll teach you how to play each game and give you some tips on how to win.

Let's start with Casino War. The basic strategy for Casino War is to always bet on the player. This gives you the best chance of winning, as the house edge is only 2.78%. If you bet on the banker, the house edge jumps up to 3.64%.

When it comes to Blackjack 21+3, things are a bit more complicated. The basic strategy is to always stand when your hand totals 17 or higher, and hit when your hand totals 16 or lower. However, this isn't always the best course of action. For example, if the dealer has a five showing and you have a six, doubling down may be a better option than hitting.

In general, it's always important to keep an eye on the dealer's cards and make sure you're making the smartest decisions possible in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. Use these tips along with our other Blackjack 21+3 articles to improve your game and come out ahead at the casino!

# The Best Way to Win at Casino War and Blackjack 21+3 Games 

Casino War is a very simple game that can be played with a minimum of fuss. The game is based on the principle of chance, and the outcome of a round is determined by the roll of a die. Blackjack 21+3 is a more complicated game, but the basic premise is still chance-based. If you want to win more often than not when playing these games, there are some tips and strategies you can use.

In Casino War, if you bet on the side of the player, you can improve your chances of winning by following some simple guidelines. First, always remember that the aim of the game is to beat the dealer, not to tie him. Therefore, you should never go for the tie option – always wager on the player instead. Secondly, make sure you bet an amount that will allow you to cover at least half of the possible outcomes. For example, if you are betting $10 per round, then your maximum bet should be $5 – this will ensure that you don’t lose all your money in one go if the dice rolls in favor of the dealer. Finally, keep an eye on the other players at the table. If they are all betting big amounts on high numbers, it might be worth betting small yourself and waiting for a better opportunity later in the game.

In Blackjack 21+3, basic strategy dictates that you should always stand when your hand totals 17 or more. This gives you a better chance of winning than hitting – especially against weaker hands. In addition, remember to split 8s and Aces whenever possible, and always take insurance against Blackjack. By following these simple tips, you can increase your chances of winning when playing Blackjack 21+3 significantly.

# Never Lose Again at Casino War or Blackjack 21+3 Games - Here's How!

Casino War and Blackjack 21+3 are two of the most popular casino games. If you're not familiar with them, they're both simple games that can be learned in minutes, but offer plenty of strategy and excitement for experienced players.

Both games are based on the principle of risk and reward: You bet against the house, and if your hand is better than the house's hand, you win a prize equal to your original bet multiplied by a factor determined by the game. However, if the house's hand is better than yours, you lose your bet.

This makes both games exciting to play, as there's always the potential for a big payoff if you're lucky. But it also means that you can lose money quickly if you're not careful. In this article, we'll show you how to avoid losing money at Casino War and Blackjack 21+3, so that you can enjoy these games without worry.

# Avoiding Disaster at Casino War

Casino War is a very simple game, but there are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning. Here are our top tips for avoiding disaster at Casino War:

1. Never surrender! surrendering gives the house an automatic advantage over players who don't surrender, so it's always best to avoid doing this.


  2. Remember the odds: The odds of winning increase as your hand gets closer to 21. So make sure to keep track of how many cards remain in the deck, and act accordingly.

  3. Don't go all-in: Unless you're absolutely confident in your chances of winning, it's always best to leave some chips on the table Maintaining your bankroll gives you more flexibility when making future bets, which increases your chances of winning overall.

  4. Know when to fold: If you're dealt a weak hand, it's often best to fold rather than risk losing even more money. Remember - it's better to walk away with something than nothing at all!
