#  How to make a new cardboard slot machine Twain 

This article will show you how to make a new cardboard slot machine Twain.

You will need:
1. A printer 
2. Paper 
3. Scissors 
4. A ruler 
5. A glue stick 
6. A piece of cardboard (at least 15 in x 23 in) 
7. Hole punch 
8. 6 craft sticks (at least 3 in long) 
9. Ribbon (optional) 
10. String (optional) 
11. Tape (optional)
12 Play money or poker chips



Instructions:

 1) Print out the template provided at the end of this article on regular paper. The template is two pieces that need to be glued together once cut out. Do not scale the template up or down, it is designed to be printed as-is on standard 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper . If your printer cannot handle such large prints, print out two copies and tape them together when finished .

2) Cut out the template along the solid black lines . Measure and cut a piece of cardboard to match the dimensions of the template – 15 in wide by 23in long . If your cardboard is thinner than the template, it is ok to use a thicker cardboard such as from a cereal box . However, if your cardboard is thicker than the template, you will need to trim off some of the excess so that everything matches up .

3) Fold all of the dotted lines accordion-style . Starting from one side, glue each fold as you go . Make sure that when you’re done folding and gluing, all of the folded lines are on one side and there are no loose flaps sticking out anywhere .

4) Use a hole punch to make two holes in each end of the folded rectangle – four holes total – about 1/2 in from the edge . Place one hole punch mark towards top and bottom center as indicated on template for proper placement .

5) Take four craft sticks and glue them into place on either side of where the coin slot would be on an actual slot machine as indicated by dashed line on template . Allow these to dry completely before moving on . Tip: hold each stick in place with clothespins while waiting for glue to dry !

6) Cut two pieces of ribbon – each at least 36in in length –and tie them through each set of holes created in Step 4 making sure that they are even on both sides when looking at front or back of machine . Now take a look at your machine… it should be looking more like an actual slot machine now ! You can also attach string instead of ribbon if you prefer .. just make sure it’s tight enough so that when spun around it doesn’t come undone easily .

7) To create card pocket , measure 2 5/8 in from left side and draw a line vertically downwards . Do same thing from right side , measuring 2 5/8in in and drawing a line vertically upwards meeting previous line creating an "L" shape as shown on Template drawing . Once both lines are drawn , use a sharp scissors to carefully cut out entire card pocket area including slots as shown .. this will become your drop box for playing cards . Be very careful not to cut off any other parts of your machine while doing this !

8 ) Glue gun onto bottom center front edge as shown on Template drawing (make sure Twain’s head is facing forward when looking at front of machine ) .. this will be your "ON" button allowing player start & stop game play ! You can also add any other decorative touches at this point such as stickers, rhinestones, etc .. have fun with it ! Templates provided below so you can get started today !!

#  How to make a cardboard slot machine that really works 

Slot machines are a lot of fun and provide hours of entertainment, but they can also be expensive. With this project, you can make your own slot machine for a fraction of the cost!

Supplies:
-A shoebox or other cardboard box
-A ruler or other straight edge
-A knife or other sharp object
-Tape
-Scissors
-Pennies
-Playing cards 
-Poker chips (optional)

1. Cut two slots in one side of the shoebox, each about 1" wide and 3" long. These will be the "wheels" of the machine.
2. On the opposite side of the box, make a rectangular opening that is big enough to fit your hand through. This will be the "coin slot." 
3. Cut a small flap in the top of the box, just big enough to fit a penny through. This will be the "payout door." 
4. Cover all openings and sharp edges with tape to prevent cuts. 
5. To make the "handle," cut a piece of cardboard that is about 4" x 6". Make a small hole in the center and fold it into a tube shape so that it can fit over one end of the box like a handle. Tape it in place. 
6. If you want to use poker chips as tokens, now is the time to glue them to the playing cards. One chip goes on each corner of each card. The Ace of Spades is a good choice because it has a large chip on it already. 
7. That's it! Your machine is ready to go!

To play, put one penny in the payout door and turn the handle to spin the wheels. The goal is to get three matching symbols on one wheel, which pays out according to this chart:

      |3 | 2 | 1 |0 |
Blank space | - | - | - |120|

 So if you get three hearts on one wheel, for example, you would win two pennies (because 2 x 120 = 240).

Making a cardboard slot machine is a fun and easy project that you can do with materials you have around the house. You will need:
Two pieces of cardboard, one slightly smaller than the other
A ruler or other straight edge
A pencil
An X-Acto knife or sharp scissors
Scotch tape
Coin slots (you can make your own with a Stanley knife)
One or more coins

1. Cut the two pieces of cardboard to the desired size. For this project, I used an 8x11 piece for the base and a 5x8 piece for the top.


2. Draw a straight line across the middle of the larger piece of cardboard. This will be the fold line for the slot machine.


3. Cut along the fold line, making two equal halves.


4. On one of the halves, draw lines 1" in from each edge on all four sides. These will be your scoring lines for folding the cardboard later on.



    
5. Cut along each of the scoring lines, making sure not to cut through the fold line itself.


6. Score along each of the fold lines using a blunt object, like a ballpoint pen or chopstick. This will help ensure a nice clean fold later on.



      
7. Tape one half of the smaller piece of cardboard to one half of the larger piece, lining up the edges as best as possible. Be sure to use plenty of tape, especially along the fold line!

	8a . If you're going to be using coin slots, now is a good time to make them! Using a Stanley knife, cut out two rectangles measuring 1/2"x1/4". Make sure they are nicely centered on opposite sides of the machine. If you don't have coin slots, you can skip this step!

8b . Flip over your machine so that it is standing on its scored fold line. Fold up all four sides until they meet inthe center (forming your slot machine!). Use plenty of Scotch tape to hold everything in place while it dries.

	9 . Place one or more coins into the coin slots and pull back onthe handle!

#  How to make a simple and fun cardboard slot machine Mark Twain 

Cardboard slot machines are a great way to have some fun while you're learning about basic circuitry. They're also really easy and inexpensive to make.

To make your own, you'll need:

- a cardboard box (or two)
- a hot glue gun
- scissors
- an LED light (optional)
- a battery pack (optional)

1. Cut the top off of one of the boxes and cut a small window out of the side. This will be your machine's "payout slot."
2. Glue the top of the other box to the underside of the first box so that it forms a base. Make sure the glued-together boxes are square or rectangular, not circular.
3. Cut two slots into each side of the upper box, near the top. These will be where you insert your coins (or tokens).
4. Cut a small notch out of the front of the machine, below the payout slot. This is where you'll put your finger to activate the lever that spins the wheels.
5. Optional: If you want your machine to light up, cut a hole in the upper box and attach an LED light. Be sure to insert a battery pack if you do this!
6. Use hot glue to attach assorted decorations to your machine: levers, knobs, buttons, whatever you like!

#  Create your own working cardboard slot machine Mark Twain

## Introduction

Slot machines have intrigued and amused people for many years. While the odds of winning are often stacked against players, there is something about the allure of pulling the lever and watching the reels spin that makes people come back for more.

Now, you can experience the fun of a slot machine without leaving your home by building your own working cardboard slot machine! This project is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon or to keep kids occupied on a weekend.

All you need to get started is some cardboard, a hot glue gun, scissors, and some paint or markers to decorate your machine. The steps below will show you how to create your own slot machine that actually works. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Cut out the Cardboard Pieces

The first step is to cut out all of the pieces you will need for your machine. The main pieces are the body and base of the machine, the lever, and three different sized drums. You can freehand these shapes or find templates online. Be sure to make copies of each piece so you have extras in case any get damaged during construction.

## Step 2: Assemble the Body and Base of the Machine
The body and base of the machine are both made from two identical rectangular pieces of cardboard. Glue them together so they form a square shape, making sure that the glued edges are flat and even. If you want, you can also add details such as hinges or latches onto this piece now.

 ## Step 3: Create the Lever Glue one end of the lever onto the top front corner of the body of the machine. It should be positioned so that when it is pulled down, it hits one of the drums directly in front of it. You may need to adjust its height depending on the size of your drums. ## Step 4: Add Details and Decorate Your Machine Now it's time to add some personality to your machine! You can use paint, markers, or stickers to decorate it any way you like. Be creative and have fun with it!
