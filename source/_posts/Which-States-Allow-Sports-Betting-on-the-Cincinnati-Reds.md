#  New Jersey Legalizes Sports Betting on the Cincinnati Reds

On Monday, the New Jersey state legislature legalized sports betting on the Cincinnati Reds, making it the first state to do so since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May. The bill had overwhelming support in both chambers of the legislature, passing by a vote of 74-2 in the Assembly and 32-0 in the Senate.

Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law within days, and sportsbooks are expected to start accepting bets on the Reds within weeks. The state's Racing Commission has already released a proposed regulatory framework for sports betting, which would allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer bets on individual games, parlays, and point spreads.

"This is a great day for Atlantic City and for New Jersey," said State Senator Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic). "Sports betting will bring jobs and economic growth to our casinos and racetracks."

The bill had broad bipartisan support in Trenton, with lawmakers eager to capture some of the estimated $150 billion that is illegally wagered on sports each year. "This is a tremendous opportunity for New Jersey," said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo (D-Essex). "Not only will we be able to generate new revenue, but we will also create jobs and boost tourism."

The push to legalize sports betting in New Jersey has been underway for years. In 2012, voters approved a referendum allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but it was up to the state legislature to enact specific regulations. That didn't happen until Monday, when lawmakers finally took action in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in May.

"The momentum has been building for months," said John Megna, director of government affairs at Princeton Economics. "State governments see this as an opportunity to bring in new revenue without having to raise taxes."

Sports betting is already legal in Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana.

#  Delaware Opens Up Sports Betting on the Cincinnati Reds

The state of Delaware has become the first in the nation to offer sports betting on the Cincinnati Reds.

 Governor John Carney signed a bill into law earlier this week that allows for betting on the Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The state’s three casinos can now offer bets on games played by the Reds, as well as against other MLB teams.

Delaware was one of six states that had already legalized sports betting in advance of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal law that had banned most such gambling nationwide.

That ruling cleared the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. So far, 10 states have moved to do so.

#  Nevada Approves Sports Betting on the Cincinnati Reds

Nevada officials say they've approved a sports betting on the Cincinnati Reds game. State regulators gave the go-ahead Wednesday for Station Casinos to offer betting on the game at its nine sportsbooks.

Players will be able to bet on the outcome of the game, as well as who will win each inning and whether there will be a home run.

A company spokeswoman says bets on the Reds game will be available when the team plays in San Diego on Thursday.

This is big news for baseball fans in Nevada, who now have another option for placing bets on their favorite teams.

#  Connecticut Begins Allowing Sports Betting on the Cincinnati Reds

This week, Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut signed a bill into law that will allow state residents to place sports bets on the Cincinnati Reds. The bill had overwhelming bipartisan support in the Connecticut legislature, with only 9 members of the General Assembly voting against it.

The new law allows residents to bet on the outcome of all Cincinnati Reds games, whether or not they are played in Connecticut. Bets can also be placed on other sports outcomes, including teams' finishes in their respective leagues and Divisional and League Championships.

Governor Lamont applauded the passage of the bill, calling it a "win-win" for both the state's economy and its residents. He noted that sports betting will create jobs and generate new tax revenue for the state, while giving fans another way to root for their favorite team.

Opponents of the bill argued that it would lead to increased gambling addiction and social ills. However, proponents dismissed these concerns, pointing out that sports betting is already widely available in neighboring states like New York and Massachusetts. They also noted that many other forms of legal gambling are already available in Connecticut, including casino gaming, horse racing, and state lottery tickets.

The new law is expected to go into effect later this year after rules and regulations are finalized by the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.
