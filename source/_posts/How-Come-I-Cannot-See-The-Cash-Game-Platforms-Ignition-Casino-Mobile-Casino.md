#  How To Play Blackjack On Your Mobile Device

 blackjack, one of the most popular card games in the world, can now be played on your mobile device. In this article we will show you how to play blackjack on your mobile device and give you some tips on how to improve your chances of winning.

To play blackjack on your mobile device, first you need to find a casino that offers a mobile app. There are many different casinos that offer mobile apps, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find one that suits your needs. Once you have found a casino that offers a mobile app, download it and install it on your device.

Once the app is installed, open it and sign in using your account details. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one before you can start playing. Once you have signed in, select the 'Blackjack' tab and then tap on the green 'Deal' button to start the game.

The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can achieve this by either drawing cards or hitting (taking another card). If you go over 21, you bust and lose the hand. The dealer also has to draw cards until they reach 17 or above, at which point they must stand.

In order to win money in blackjack, your hand must beat the dealers hand. If your hand is lower than the dealers hand, you lose money equal to the amount bet. If your hand is higher than the dealers hand, you win money equal to the amount bet minus the dealershand. For example, if you bet £10 and beat the dealers hand with a total of 21 (£10), you would win £5 (£10 - £5).

There are a few basic tips that can help improve your chances of winning at blackjack:

- Always split Aces and 8s
- Never split 5s or 10s
- Double down when you have a good chance of winning (11 or more)
- Never take insurance
