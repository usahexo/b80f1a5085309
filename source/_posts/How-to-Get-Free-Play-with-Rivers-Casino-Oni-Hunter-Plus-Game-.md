# How To Play Oni Hunter Plus 

When it comes to playing Oni Hunter Plus, there are a few things players will want to know beforehand. The first thing is that the game is played in rounds. During each round, players will be able to take actions using their four cards. These cards will be used to either claim resources, summon allies, or attack enemies. The goal is to be the last player standing, so make sure you use your cards wisely! 

Another thing players should note is that they can only claim resources from the tiles on which their character stands. This means that if you want to get your hands on those sweet resources, you’ll need to make sure your character is in the right spot. Finally, pay attention to your opponent’s moves – they may be planning an attack of their own! 

# Choose Your Strategy Wisely 

When playing Oni Hunter Plus, it’s important to choose your strategy wisely. Do you go all out and attack your opponents as soon as possible? Or do you focus on gathering resources and summoning allies? There’s no right or wrong answer; it all depends on what works best for you. However, it’s always a good idea to adapt your strategy depending on what your opponents are doing. If they start gaining a lot of ground, maybe it’s time for a strategic retreat and rebuild! 

# Claim Resources And Stay Alive 
The ultimate goal of Oni Hunter Plus is simple: stay alive and claim resources. Although it may seem like an easy task at first, things can quickly become complicated as the game progresses. Make sure you keep an eye on both your allies and enemies; one wrong move could mean defeat. Remember: claiming resources is key if you want to come out on top!
