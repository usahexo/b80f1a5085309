#  What are the expected damages from the fire? 

The fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris caused significant damages, with initial estimates of $1 billion. The full extent of the damage is still not known, but it is clear that the cathedral will need extensive repairs. 

According to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, the government will launch an international fundraising campaign to help pay for the reconstruction. Philippe said that the campaign will be led by France's culture minister, Franck Riester. He added that the government will also provide financial assistance for the reconstruction. 

It is still not clear how much the reconstruction will cost, but it is likely to be several hundred million euros. The cathedral has been damaged before, and has been repaired on several occasions. However, this time the damage is much more extensive, and it is unclear whether or not it can be fully repaired. 

The fire at Notre Dame Cathedral was a tragedy, and its effects will be felt for many years to come. But we must remember that this is a historic building, and it can be rebuilt. We must come together to support France as they rebuild one of their most iconic landmarks.

#  When did the fire start? 

The fire started at around 10pm on the night of April 20th in the West Warehouse. It is still unknown what started the fire, as the cause is still under investigation.

# What were the damages? 

The damages from the fire were extensive, with smoke and water damage throughout the building. The main areas that were damaged were the warehouse and office space. In addition, several vehicles parked in the lot were also destroyed in the fire.

# What was lost in the fire? 

The main thing that was lost in the fire was merchandise that was housed in the warehouse. This included clothing, shoes, and other accessories. It is still unclear exactly how much merchandise was destroyed in the fire, but it is estimated to be around $1 million worth.

#  How many people are employed at the gambling establishment? 

A study by the University of Amsterdam found that in the Netherlands, there are about 12,000 people employed in gambling halls. The majority of these employees are men, and many work part-time. This study also found that casino employees often have little training and receive low pay.

#  Who is responsible for the fire?

The mystery of who started the massive fire in the Brazilian Museum in September of 2018 still remains. The museum, which was over 200 years old, was home to over 20 million items including archeological artifacts and historical memorabilia. The fire caused extensive damage and officials report that it may take up to five years to restore the museum fully.

Despite an extensive investigation, officials have been unable to identify who started the fire. There were no security cameras in the museum and no witnesses have come forward. Officials have ruled out arson but have not been able to determine a cause for the fire.

The museum was not well funded and was in disrepair before the fire. It is possible that a malfunctioning electrical appliance or a heat source from a nearby construction site may have been responsible for the fire. However, until officials can determine a definitive cause, the identity of the person responsible for starting the fire remains a mystery.
